#Sparkle Turntable Bot

A customizable Turntable.fm bot written in node.js utilizing [ttapi](https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API).

This bot is still relatively early in development, and some features are developed for/catered to the Indie/Classic Alt room, and may not apply to all rooms. Please report any bugs you find.

New: SparkleBot is now on npm! Use `npm install sparklebot` to install Sparkle and all dependencies, then use the guide above to set up your config file.

## Help

If you have a **nontrivial** question, feel free to contact me. I'm usually hanging out in the [Indie/Classic Alt 1+Done room](http://turntable.fm/indieclassic_alternative_1_done) on Turntable.
